  "scheme_name": "Pradhan Mantri Adarsh Gram Yojana",
  "description": "The Pradhan Mantri Adarsh Gram Yojana (PMAGY) was launched in 2009-10 with an area-based development approach, aiming for the integrated development of Scheduled Castes (SC) majority villages. Its principal objective is achieved through two main avenues: convergent implementation of relevant Central and State/UT Government Schemes, and by providing 'Gap-filling' funds as Central Assistance up to ₹20,00,000/- per village for activities not covered by existing schemes. The scheme was piloted in 1000 villages across Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, and Assam, all of which have been declared 'Adarsh Grams'. An 'Adarsh Gram' envisions a village where residents have access to all basic services, minimum needs are met, disparities are reduced, and an environment for dignified living and full potential utilization is created.",
