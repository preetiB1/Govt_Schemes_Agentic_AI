  "scheme_name": "Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha Evam Utthan Mahabhiyan Scheme For Farmers.",
  "description": "The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha Evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan Yojana (PM-KUSUM Scheme) was launched in March 2019 by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) to subsidize farmers for installing solar irrigation pumps. Farmers receive a 60% subsidy and a 30% loan for tube wells and pump sets, bearing only 10% of the cost. The scheme aims to provide cutting-edge technology for de-dieselized irrigation, promote eco-friendly solar pumps, and enable farmers to sell excess power to the government to enhance their income. It comprises three components: Component A for grid-connected decentralized solar plants (500KW to 2MV), Component B for stand-alone solar pumps (up to 7.5HP), and Component C for solarization of existing grid-connected agricultural pumps (up to 7.5HP).",
  "benefits": [
    "The Indian Government initiated the construction of solar plants that can generate an aggregate of 28,250 MW of power.",
    "The Government will subsidize 60% and provide a loan of 30% of the total cost, leading farmers to bear only 10% of the total cost to install solar plants and solar pumps.",
    "The Government will provide subsidies to install state-of-the-art solar pumps, improving irrigation with 720MV capacity.",
    "Farmers have the opportunity to sell extra power generated by the plants directly to the Government, increasing their income.",
    "Landholders in rural areas can get a stable source of income by utilizing barren and uncultivated land for solar plant implementation for 25 years.",
    "Solar plants will be set up above a minimum height in cultivable lands, allowing farmers to continue cultivation after installation.",
    "The scheme ensures increasing use of renewable energy, helping to mitigate pollution in farms and opening a gateway to eco-friendly cultivation."
